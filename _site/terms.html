                    obligations with respect to

                    party irreparable injury for which there are

                    remedies at law, and that the injured party
                    shall be entitled to seek equitable relief in
                    addition

                    principle, law or regulation, or is
                    invalidated by a court decision, it shall be
                    severed from the
                    Agreement, but the other provisions of the
                    Agreement shall remain in full force and

                    performance of its obligation(s).The Parties shall
                    meet in order to jointly determine the conditions
                    for resuming performance of the Agreement as soon
                    as possible. If a Force Majeure event continues for
