      <h2 class="pt-3">Why use Labelmaker?</h2>
      <p>
        With Labelmaker, you can
        <span class="font-weight-bold">make your own labels at home</span>.
        Labelmaker lets you create professional labels as well as labels for
        special occasions.
      </p>
      <h2 class="pt-3">Our story</h2>
      <p>
        Before Labelmaker, there used to be a free label merge add-on called
        <span class="font-italic">Avery Label merge</span>. However, this add-on
        was discontinued from the Google Workspace Marketplace. A great number
        of Google Suite users, including us, missed the opportunity to print
        labels using Google Docs or Google Sheets. That's why we decided to fix
        this situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are team of independent developers based in Paris, France. In the
        past, we have built several of the most popular Google add-ons.
        Developing apps that make everyone's work a little less boring is how we
        make a living. It's our daily source of delight.
      </p>
      <h2 class="pt-3">Why Labelmaker is not free?</h2>
      <p>
        Labelmaker has grown to millions of users over the years. It's amazing
        to know that Labelmaker is used by millions of people each day, and we
        hope it will
        <span class="font-weight-bold">make your life easier</span> too.
      </p>
      <p>
        We want your customer experience to remain the best possible while
        continue to improve Labelmaker by adding new features and labels. That's
        why we've introduced <a href="/pricing">paid plans</a> to support the
        development of the add-on. Labelmaker has several plans for all kinds of
        budget, that you can cancel anytime.
      </p>
      <p>
        With Labelmaker, you get access to the best tool to mail merge labels
        with Google as well as a supportive community to help you create your
        perfect labels.
      </p>
