                    personal data from unauthorised
                    disclosure. In using industry
                    recommended methods of encoding,
                    Labelmaker
                    takes the measures necessary to protect

                    credit cards.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">Moreover, in order to avoid in

                    and
                    managerial procedures in place with a

                    its
                    services.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">Nothwithstanding this, there is no
                    absolute safety from piracy or hackers.
                    That is
                    why in the event a breach of security
                    were to affect you, Labelmaker

                    and minimise the impacts. Should you
                    suffer any loss by reason of the

                    of a
                    security breach, Labelmaker undertakes
                    to provide you with every assistance
                    necessary so you are
                    able to
                    assert your rights. Moreover if, by
                    some exceptional case, the direct loss
                    incurred arose due to
                    fault or
                    gross negligence by Labelmaker, you
                    will be able to seek compensation
                    within the limit of liability
                    referred to in our <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">You should keep in mind that any user,
                    customer or hacker who discovers and

                    advantage of a breach in security
                    renders him or herself liable to
                    criminal prosecution and that
                    Labelmaker
                    will take all measures, including
                    filing a complaint and/or bringing
                    court action, to preserve the
                    data and
