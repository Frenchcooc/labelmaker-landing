            <h2 id="open-document">1. Open a new Google Docs</h2>
            <p>First of all, <a href="https://docs.new">open a new document</a> in Google Docs. This document will be used to create your wedding labels.
            </p>
            <img alt="Open a document in Google Docs" src="/assets/images/guides/wedding-labels/1-open-document.webp">

        <div class="guide-section">
            <h2 id="open-labelmaker">2. Open Labelmaker</h2>
            <p>Now go to the "Extensions" and select "Create & Print Labels". If you haven‚Äôt installed the add-on yet, you can <a href='https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/create_print_labels_label_maker_for_aver/585829216542'>install Labelmaker</a> from the Google Workspace Marketplace. When you‚Äôve installed the add-on, make sure to refresh your browser to ensure everything works.

        <div class="guide-section">
            <h2 id="select-template">3. Select a template</h2>
            <p>Within the Labelmaker sidebar on the right, click on "Select a template". You will be given several template options. There are more than 5000 templates available including Avery wedding labels. In this tutorial, we will show you how to create wedding stickers using the widely popular 5160 template from Avery¬Æ. 
            </p>

        <div class="guide-section">
            <h2 id="insert-table">4. Insert a table</h2>
            <p>You might certainly want to customize your wedding sticker with images. To add an image on your wedding labels, you need to add a table in the first cell of your document (that is the one with the black borders). The table will help us align our text with the image. You can skip this step if you don't want to insert an image onto your wedding labels.
            </p>
            <p>In order to insert a table, place your mouse in the first cell with the black borders and reduce the font size to 1. This will leave some free space for the table we‚Äôre going to insert. Then, insert a two-column table by going to ‚ÄúInsert‚Äù > ‚ÄúTable‚Äù then select  2X1 (2 columns, one row table).</p>
            <p>Note: check our dedicated guide on <a href="/guide/how-to-add-images-labels-google-docs">How to add images in your labels in Google Docs</a> for detailed guidance.</p>

        <div class="guide-section">
            <h2 id="add-image-and-text">5. Add an image and text</h2>
            <p>Now that you have a table in the first cell, you can add an image on your wedding labels. To insert your image, select ‚ÄúImage‚Äù in the menu at the top then ‚ÄúUpload from computer‚Äù. Make sure to resize the image to ensure it fits your labels. Then, type in your text. Feel free to increase the font size, add some colors, pick a font that you enjoy to personalize your wedding labels.

        <div class="guide-section">
            <h2 id="remove-table-borders">6. Remove table borders</h2>
            <p>Now we can get rid of the table‚Äôs black borders because we don‚Äôt want them to be printed. Select the table (drag your mouse from the bottom right corner to the top left corner of the table), then turn the border width to 0pt as shown below.

            <h2 id="personalize-labels">7. Personalize your wedding labels</h2>
            <p>That‚Äôs it! You‚Äôve create one wedding label. Now, you can either copy and paste this label into other cells or use Labelmaker to generate a full page of labels for you.</p>
            <p>Note that if you‚Äôre looking to address wedding invites, it‚Äôs possible to print wedding invitations for a mailing list. Let‚Äôs say you have a spreadsheet with the list of your guests, you could print out personalized invitations with their names and other personal information.

            <p>When you‚Äôre happy with your wedding labels design, click on ‚ÄúCreate labels‚Äù in the Labelmaker sidebar on the right. If you want to print a full page of the same looking labels, then tick the ‚ÄúUse first cell as model‚Äù box. Wait a few moments, then click on "Open document" when your wedding labels are ready.

            <h2 id="print-wedding-labels">10. Print your Wedding labels</h2>
            <p>You‚Äôre ready to print your own wedding labels at home. To print your labels, click on "File" > "Print". In the print window, check that the margin is set to none and the scale to 100%. Depending on the label format you chose, you might need to adapt the size of the page. In our example, the Avery¬Æ US Letter 5160 requires the size to be "Letter".
