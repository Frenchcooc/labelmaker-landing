            <h2 id="open-document">1. Open a document in Google Docs</h2>
            <p>First, <a href="https://docs.new">open a new document</a> in Google Docs and leave it blank. That document will be used to create and print the Christmas labels.
            </p>

        <div class="guide-section">
            <h2 id="open-labelmaker">2. Open Labelmaker</h2>
            <p>Then, go to the &quot;Add-ons&quot; menu and select &quot;Create & Print Labels&quot;. If you haven‚Äôt installed the add-on yet, you can <a href='https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/create_print_labels_label_maker_for_aver/585829216542'>install Labelmaker</a> from the Google Workspace Marketplace. When the installation is finished, you might need to  reload your document by closing it and reopening it and the add-on will appear.</p>

        <div class="guide-section">
            <h2 id="select-template">3. Select a template</h2>
            <p>In the Labelmaker sidebar, click on &quot;Select a template&quot;. You will be given several template options. As of writing, you can choose from over 5000+ labels.</p>
            <p>There are several categories such as <i>Avery¬Æ US Letter</i>, <i>Avery¬Æ A4</i>, <i>Avery¬Æ Zweckform</i> to print Avery ¬Æ Labels for Christmas, and also <i>Sheetlabels.com</i>, <i>OnlineLabels.com</i> and <i>Herma</i>. In this label guide, we will be using the "Avery 5160" template, which is a commonly used label format.</p>

        <div class="guide-section">
            <h2 id="insert-table">4. Insert a table</h2>
            <p>Now is the time to start designing your very own labels for a special Christmas. We are going to insert an image in the labels to decorate them.
            </p>
            <p>To add an image in your Christmas labels, you need to insert a table in the first cell (the box with black borders). Inserting a table will allow you to have an image as well as some text on your label displayed next to it.</p>
            <p>The example below shows you the result after inserting an image in your Christmas labels. Let's do it together step-by-step:</p>
            <img alt="Adding an image into your Chrismtas labels using a table" src="/assets/images/guides/christmas-labels/4-1-insert-table-result.webp">
            <p>
                First, place your mouse inside the first cell, the one with black borders, and reduce the font size to 1. This will make some space for the table we're going to insert. It‚Äôs not compulsory but we advise you to do it so the table fits properly into the cell.
            </p>
            <img alt="Reduce font size inside the table" src="/assets/images/guides/christmas-labels/4-2-insert-table-resize.webp">
            <p>
                Then, go to the &quot;Insert&quot; menu at the top, click &quot;Table&quot; and select 2 squares (2X1) as shown here.
            </p>
            <img alt="Inserting a table inside your first cell" src="/assets/images/guides/christmas-labels/4-3-insert-table.webp">
        </div>
        <div class="guide-section">
            <h2 id="add-image-and-text">5. Add an image and text</h2>
            <p>Select the image you want to appear on your labels and save it somewhere in your computer. Then in Google Docs, follow the steps:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Go to the &quot;Insert&quot; menu at the top 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Select &quot;Image&quot; then &quot;Upload from computer&quot;. You can also drag and drop your image directly from your computer into the first cell. <span class="font-weight-bold">When inserting your image, make sure it doesn't modify the first cell's height. If your image is too large, try to reduce its size to make it fit. Otherwise your labels will not align properly when printed.</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Once the image is in the cell, add your text in the other part of the table.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p class="font-italic">Tip: to enlarge your text, highlight it and click on ‚ÄúNormal text‚Äù then choose the font and size you like.
            </p>
            <img alt="Add an image and text in your Christmas labels" src="/assets/images/guides/christmas-labels/5-add-image.webp">
        </div>
        <div class="guide-section">
            <h2 id="remove-table-borders">6. Remove table borders</h2>
            <p>Next step, we need to remove the black borders on the outside of the table because we don't want them to appear on our Christmas labels. To do so, select your table (drag your mouse from the bottom right corner to the top left corner), then from the menu in the top right corner, turn the border width to 0pt.
            </p>
            <img alt="Remove table borders on Christmas labels" src="/assets/images/guides/christmas-labels/6-remove-borders.webp">
        </div>
        <div class="guide-section">
            <h2 id="personalize-labels">7. Personalize your labels</h2>
            <p>You‚Äôve done it! You can now follow the same steps for the other cells and create gift tags for everyone. Simply copy paste the content of the firs cells to other cells and add a personal touch to your gift tags. You could create one for each of your family members or relatives.
            </p>
            <img alt="Personalize Xmas labels in Google Docs" src="/assets/images/guides/christmas-labels/7-personalize-labels.webp">
            <p>To create a variety of labels, you can also use <a href="/guides/how-to-print-labels-mailing-list-google-sheets">mailing list</a>. That way you could print Christmas labels and use personalized information from your mailing list such as a Name, Address, City State, Zip Code... Here is an example below where the First name will be personalized based on your contacts information.
            </p>

                max-width: 50%;
                margin: 2rem auto;
                display: block;"

        </div>
        <div class="guide-section">
            <h2 id="create-labels">8. Create the labels</h2>
            <p>Once you are done creating your Christmas labels, click on &quot;Create labels&quot; at the bottom of the sidebar, on the right. Don‚Äôt forget to untick ‚ÄúUse first cell as model‚Äù (unless you want to print a full page of the same. Wait for the labels to be ready and click on &quot;Open document&quot;.</p>

        <div class="guide-section">
            <h2 id="preview-labels">9. Preview before printing</h2>
            <p>Before printing your work, check that everything is in order, that there are no misalignment issues. Should you need to make some changes, just go back to the original document. Once the modifications are made, simply click on "Create labels'' again. This will create another page of labels.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="guide-section">
            <h2 id="print-christmas-labels">10. Print your Christmas labels</h2>
            <p>To print your Christmas tags, click on &quot;File&quot; > &quot;Print&quot;. In the print dialogue, check that the margin is set to none and the scale to 100%. Depending on the label format you chose, you might need to adapt the size of the page. In our example, the Avery¬Æ US Letter 5160 requires the size to be &quot;Letter&quot;.
