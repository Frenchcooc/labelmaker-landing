      <p>
        To begin, <a href="https://docs.new">open a new document</a> in Google Docs. You can leave it blank. This document will be used to create and print the Black Friday labels.

      <h2 id="open-labelmaker">2. Open Labelmaker</h2>
      <p>
        Then, go to the &quot;Extensions&quot; menu (previously named &quot;Add-ons&quot;) and select &quot;Create & Print Labels&quot;. If you haven‚Äôt installed the Labekmaker
        add-on yet, you can <a href="https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/create_print_labels_label_maker_for_aver/585829216542">install Labelmaker</a> from the Google
        Workspace Marketplace. When the installation is finished, you might need to reload your document by closing it and reopening it and the add-on will appear.

      <h2 id="select-template">3. Select a template</h2>
      <p>In the Labelmaker sidebar, click on &quot;Select a template&quot;. You will be given several template options. As of writing, you can choose from over 5000+ labels.</p>
      <p>
        There are several categories such as <i>Avery¬Æ US Letter</i>, <i>Avery¬Æ A4</i>, <i>Avery¬Æ Zweckform</i> to print Avery ¬Æ Labels for Black Friday, and also
        <i>Sheetlabels.com</i>, <i>OnlineLabels.com</i> and <i>Herma</i>. In this label guide, we will be using the "Avery 5160" template, which is a commonly used label format.

      <h2 id="design-label">4. Design your label</h2>
      <p>Now is the time to start designing your very own labels for a special Black Friday. We are going to insert an image in the labels to decorate them.</p>
      <p>The example below shows you the end-result. Let's do it together step-by-step:</p>
      <img alt="Adding an image into your Black Friday using a table" src="/assets/images/guides/black-friday-labels/4-design-label.webp" />
      <p>First, place your mouse inside the first cell, the one with black borders. Then add some text inside your cell.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="guide-section">
      <h2 id="personalize-labels">5. Personalize your labels</h2>
      <p>
        To create a variety of labels, you can also use a <a href="/guides/how-to-print-labels-mailing-list-google-sheets">mailing list</a>. That way you could print Black Friday
        labels and use personalized information from your mailing list such as a Name, Address, City State, Zip Code...
      </p>
      <p>
        To add an image in your Black Friday labels, follow our guide on <a href="/guides/how-to-add-images-labels-google-docs">How to insert images in your labels</a>. It's
        possible to add QR codes to your labels for example.
      </p>

    <div class="guide-section">
      <h2 id="create-labels">6. Create the labels</h2>
      <p>
        Once you are done creating your Black Friday labels, click on &quot;Create labels&quot; at the bottom of the sidebar, on the right. Don‚Äôt forget to untick ‚ÄúUse first cell
        as model‚Äù (unless you want to print a full page of the same labels). Wait for the labels to be ready and click on &quot;Open document&quot;.

    <div class="guide-section">
      <h2 id="preview-labels">7. Preview before printing</h2>
      <p>
        Before printing your work, check that everything is in order, that there are no misalignment issues. Should you need to make some changes, just go back to the original
        document. Once the modifications are made, simply click on "Create labels'' again. This will create another page of labels.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="guide-section">
      <h2 id="print-black-friday-labels">8. Print your Black Friday labels</h2>
      <p>
        To print your Black Friday tags, click on &quot;File&quot; > &quot;Print&quot;. In the print dialog, check that the margin is set to none and the scale to 100%. Depending
        on the label format you chose, you might need to adapt the size of the page. In our example, the Avery¬Æ US Letter 5160 requires the size to be &quot;Letter&quot;.
